# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment
In the assignment, I firstly read in the text files as tables.  
Then I combined the measurements and added the column names.  
I use the feature of the metacharacters to find the location of those wanted features, which are the means and standard deviations.  
Then I edited the expressions of those column names and substract those wanted data from the big data set.  
Then I add the subject and activities to the data set and also factorized the subject and activities.  
In the end, I generate a text file which contains the tidy data.
